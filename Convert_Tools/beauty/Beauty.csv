B000K5JBZU,Optimum Care Anti-Breakage Therapy Moisture Replenish Cream Hairdress,5.99,A3UWJXJI7S3T05,PloveJ,1/1,5.0,1351987200,TRULY MADE A DIFFERENCE!,I have been using this product for a couple years now. I started using it because my hair had gotten so dry from all the chemical treatments and relaxers. This actualy came in the relaxer kit. I tried it and could not beleive the difference it made with one use. I could not find it in any of the stores at the time so I searched Amazon and they had it. I absolutely love it. It is the best moisturizing product I have used so far. My hair is soft with good elasticity and it is not breaking anywhere close to what it was. I am very happy with it.
